Hi, my name is Elioth, I'm a research scientist with a PhD in Operations Research from [Columbia University IEOR Department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/). Currently, I'm working on multiple projects applying Operations Research to solve real world problems. I founded [Staffing Analytics](https://www.staffinganalytics.io/), created the retail analytics plafform [Predictheus](https://predictheus.com/) and the data fusion platform [EOS Intel](https://eos-intel.io/).

Before this, I served in the NYC Government as Assistant Commissioner of Operations Research for the [Department of Correction](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doc/index.page) solving a lot of logistical optimization problems (ranging from supply chain problems, transportation optimization, staff scheduling and so on). I also served as Deputy Director of Operations Research for [FDNY](https://www.nyc.gov/site/fdny/index.page), working on ambulance scheduling to minimize response times. This work was derived from my PhD thesis advised by Prof [David D. Yao](https://www.columbia.edu/~yao/) and [Henry Lam](https://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/).
